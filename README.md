#Welcome to Thndr.

#####Thndr is a spontaneous discovery service that is exclusive to SMS.

Thndr's one and only job is to find the best location for what you're looking for and tell you where it is. It's not here to beat Google. It's here to give you an immediate answer with everything you need to know in a single text. No need to fumble around with a browser or navigation app. Just text Thndr.

Try out the MHacks-exclusive super-alpha version! Query Thndr at (678) 971-0201 with a text like this:

"Best doughnuts in New York"

"Best burgers near San Francisco"

"Best pizza in Montreal"

#####Only food joints are supported for the demo. Stay tuned!
