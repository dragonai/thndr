.. _usage:

Code is easier to understand than words, so let us dive right in ::

    YOUR_API_KEY = 'AIzaSyAiFpFd85eMtfbvmVNEYuNds5TEF9FjIPI'

    google_places = GooglePlaces(YOUR_API_KEY)

    # You may prefer to use the text_search API, instead.
    query_result = google_places.nearby_search(
            location='London, England', keyword='Fish and Chips',
            radius=20000, types=[types.TYPE_FOOD])

    if query_result.has_attributions:
        print query_result.html_attributions


    for place in query_result.places:
        # Returned places from a query are place summaries.
        print place.name
        print place.geo_location
        print place.reference

        # The following method has to make a further API call.
        place.get_details()
        # Referencing any of the attributes below, prior to making a call to
        # get_details() will raise a googleplaces.GooglePlacesAttributeError.
        print place.details # A dict matching the JSON response from Google.
        print place.local_phone_number
        print place.international_phone_number
        print place.website
        print place.url

        # Getting place photos

        for photo in place.photos:

    # Adding and deleting a place
    try:

        # Delete the place that you've just added.
        google_places.delete_place(added_place.reference)
    except GooglePlacesError as error_detail:
